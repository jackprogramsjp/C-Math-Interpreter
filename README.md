# C - Simple Math Interpreter

I tried to make this Interpreter, in CodePulse's way, but I have failed to.

So anytime you use this when evaluating math calculations, segmentation faults, memory leaks, etc, could happen. Use this at your own risk.

An interpreter, written in C, that can evaluate simple math calculations.

I'd rather write a new interpreter than update this, because everything is kind of messed up.

# Running the program

If you are using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), there is a [gcc_compile.txt](https://github.com/jackprogramsjp/C-Math-Interpreter/blob/master/gcc_compile.txt), so you can compile the interpreter into exe file.
